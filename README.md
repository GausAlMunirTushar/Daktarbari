## Introduction

The Doctor Management System API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints to manage various aspects of a healthcare facility, including doctors, patients, appointments, medical records, notifications, and administrative tasks. This API is designed to be robust, scalable, and efficient, supporting the needs of healthcare administrators, doctors, and patients alike.

## Features

- **Doctor Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete doctor profiles.
- **Patient Management**: Manage patient information, including medical records and appointments.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments between doctors and patients.
- **Medical Records**: Maintain detailed medical records for patients, accessible to authorized healthcare providers.
- **Notifications**: Send notifications (e.g., SMS, email, push notifications) to doctors and patients regarding appointments and updates.
- **Reports and Analytics**: Generate reports on appointments, patient health, and other analytics.
- **Settings Management**: Configure application-wide settings such as timezone and default values.
- **Integration**: Integrate with external systems for calendar management and payment processing.
- **Security**: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data privacy and security.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Authentication mechanism for securing API endpoints.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for caching.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: API documentation and specification.
- **Docker**: Containerization for deployment.
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Cloud services for hosting and storage.

## Installation

To run the Doctor Management System API locally or in a production environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
   cd repository
```
2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```
3. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:
```bash
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/doctor-management
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```
Adjust the values based on your local or production environment setup.

4. **Start the server:**

```bash
npm start
```
The API server will start running on http://localhost:3000 by default.
